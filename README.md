# tic-tac-toe-js - Testing

A tic tac toe - Build in JS

## Project specifications

A TicTacToe games with vanilla Javascript.

On this project, we used Jest to create unit-tests for our tic-tac-toe project. We refactored our code to separate the logic from DOM using modules like player and game logic. We also made use of Webpack and configure it in order to run our CSS styling and JS files.

Finally, we created testing files for each one of these modules and generate multiple unit tests (10+) with the purpose to verify if everything works as planned.
